**** Introduction: ****
The Candle Shop Online Ordering Portal is a console-based application developed using C++ that provides an interactive platform for customers to place customized orders for candles. 
The system allows users to select from various scented and nonscented candles, different wax types, and packaging options. It aims to enhance the online shopping experience by providing a
simple yet efficient order management system.

**** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): ****
The Candle Shop Online Ordering Portal is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure modularity and maintainability. The core features of OOP used in this system include:

> Classes and Objects:The Candle class is used to represent candle orders, encapsulating attributes such as scent, wax type,      packaging, and delivery address. Methods within the class handle 
                      the logic for order processing and displaying the order summary. 
> Encapsulation:The attributes for candle selection (scent, wax type, packaging) are encapsulated within the Candle class. This ensures that the data is securely managed and only accessed or modified
                through the class's methods. 
> Abstraction:The user interacts with a simplified interface, making selections for their candle order. The underlying complexities such as validation, cost calculation, and displaying the summary are
               abstracted into methods, making the system easy to use and extend. 
> Inheritance (Potential Future Expansion): The design allows for future enhancements, such as introducing new candle options or adding additional functionalities, using inheritance to extend the systems
                                            capabilities. 
     >> Void Funcionality
                         The system uses void functions to perform operations that do not require a return value. These void functions are essential for managing various tasks, such as: 
Input Validation: Functions validate the user√ïs selection for candle type, scent, wax type, and packaging. If an invalid option is selected, the system prompts the user to re-enter their choice 
                   until valid input is provided. 
Order Summary Display: After processing the order, the system generates and displays the order summary, including the candle name, wax type, scent, packaging, delivery address, and a breakdown of the
                       total cost. 
Code Implementation
 The system is implemented with several key functions and logic to handle the entire ordering process. The user interacts with a menu-driven interface to choose from different candle types, scents and packaging.
 The system calculates the total cost of the order based on the selections made and displays the final summary.
Order Flow:
  After the user selects their preferred candle, scent, wax, and packaging, the system calculates the cost and displays the order summary. 
Cost Calculation:
 The cost of the candle, packaging, and delivery is calculated and displayed to the user. 
**** Conclusion ****
 The Candle Shop Online Ordering Portal successfully demonstrates the use of C++ to create an interactive and efficient system for customizing and processing candle orders. By utilizing Object-Oriented
 Programming (OOP) principles and void functions, the system is highly modular, allowing for easy expansion and future enhancements. This application provides a solid foundation for developing more
 complex online shopping platforms in the future.
